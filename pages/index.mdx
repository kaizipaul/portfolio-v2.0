## Hi, I'm Paul üôãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 I'm a **Full-Stack Software Developer** from Tanzania (üáπüáø). I like tinkering around the computer a lot. I currently do web development, contribute to open source software and major in Information Security.

 I have been working on developing cutting-edge User Interface and learning about how data streams from the cloud (server) to your device and back, using the best and latest technologies. 

 Feel free to look around what I'm working on and don't hesitate to connect with me
