# Paul Kaizirege

I am a skilled full-stack developer passionate about creating polished and contemporary user interfaces. As a dedicated remote worker, I thrive on programming challenges and have experience working in teams with software developers worldwide in the past year building business websites, CRUD-based web apps, and REST APIs. With expertise in JavaScript and Ruby programming languages, React, and Ruby on Rails, I have a talent for quickly and effectively tackling new projects.
