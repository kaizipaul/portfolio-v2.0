## Hi, I'm Kai👋🏾
Hi! My name is Paul Kaizirege and I'm a  software developer from Tanzania. I have been lucky to study and graduate from [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), an online Software Development School. I have worked and collaborated with software developers, remotely from around the world for at least a year and now am looking forward to collaborate with you! 🫵🏾
I make responsive websites and webapps using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Ruby on Rails.
